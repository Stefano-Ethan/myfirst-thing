# My CSS
I'm going to upload any CSS I've repeartedly reused. If you want to use, you can. 
Full documentation :
# For Grid: 
+ <div class="wrap"> contains everything, use once.
+ <div class="row"> starts new row, repeat for each new additional row
+ <div class="column-#"> defines how many columns to span, insert for # a no. 1 - 12
